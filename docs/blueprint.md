## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#1E3A8A), reflecting the technical nature of the institution, and reliability. It provides a strong, trustworthy base for the design.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F9FF), almost white, but adds a hint of color interest without distracting from the content.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#D4AC0D), drawn from the Niger flag and symbolizing the value and quality of education offered.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, offering a neutral and modern feel.
- Use clean, modern icons related to education, technology, and community, in the golden yellow to ensure they are noticed. Use icons sparingly.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to ensure information is easily accessible and digestible. The design should focus on usability and reflect the institution's professionalism.
- Use subtle, non-intrusive animations for transitions and interactions to enhance user experience. Animations should be used to guide users, not distract them.
